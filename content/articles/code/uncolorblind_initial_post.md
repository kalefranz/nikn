title: Introducing <em>uncolorblind</em>
local_id:

I'm color blind. Or technically "color deficient." For example, most people can
see the **2** in the color plate. I can't. (Yet I can study it
closely and point out individual dots that look green-ish, orange-ish, or
red-ish to me. Weird; I know.) So an *utlra* valuable tool for me in the past
has been this [WhatColor](http://www.hikarun.com/e/) app.
Not only does it provide the RGB and Hex values for
the color on your screen directly below your mouse, it also tells you the name
of the color. I'm working mostly on OS X now, and Apple's DigitalColor Meter
just doesn't compete (or have the color name feature). **tl;dr**...I made my
own; it's called _uncolorblind_, and it's all on
[github](https://github.com/kalefranz/uncolorblind). I'll also package up
distributable binaries at some point too.
