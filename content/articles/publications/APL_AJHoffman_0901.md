Quantum cascade (QC) laser core heating is a primary impediment to high device
wall plug efficiency (WPE). Here, we demonstrate that efficient photon
generation produces a quantifiable reduction in heating of the QC laser core
temperature. By superimposing low duty cycle current pulses on a core-heating
dc baseline, we observe the instantaneous threshold current and current
efficiency evolution as the dc input is varied. From these measurements we
recover the laser core temperature _T<sub>core</sub>_. Results agree well with calculations
of _T<sub>core</sub>_ based on measured thermal resistance and WPE. Using the
same thermal model for a laser with negligible WPE, we show that the large
WPE of the measured device-—24% for an 80 K heat sink-—results in a core
temperature reduction of ~15 K.
