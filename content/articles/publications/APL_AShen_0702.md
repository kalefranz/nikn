The authors report the observation of intersubband absorption in multilayers of
CdSe/Zn<sub>x</sub>Cd<sub>y</sub>Mg<sub>1−x−y</sub>Se self-assembled quantum
dots. The samples were grown by molecular beam epitaxy on InP substrates. For
samples with the CdSe dot layers doped with Cl and with the deposited CdSe
equivalent layer thickness between 5.2 and 6.9 ML, peak absorption between 2.5
and 3.5 µm was observed. These materials are promising for intersubband devices
operating in the mid- and near-infrared ranges.
