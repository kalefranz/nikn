A systematic shift in spectral emission wavenumbers in quantum cascade lasers
(QCLs) is observed over a variation in cavity lengths from 0.5 to 3 mm resulting
in a gain peak shift ranging from 2404 to 2286 cm<sup>−1</sup>. Thereby, a wavelength
selection range of 118 cm<sup>−1</sup> is provided, which is sufficiently broad
for selecting the laser emission across the entire CO2 absorption band at
2326 cm<sup>−1</sup> (4.3 µm). In contrast to current QCL wavelength selection
techniques, modifying the cavity length is a straightforward postprocessing
procedure. Experimental evidence confirms that this frequency shift is due to a
change in threshold voltage and applied electric field as a function of cavity
length which is in agreement with the theory.
