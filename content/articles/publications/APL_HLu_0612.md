Contactless electroreflectance was measured at room temperature to characterize
a wide range of the possible optical transitions in
Zn<sub>x</sub>Cd<sub>1−x</sub>Se/Zn<sub>x'</sub>Cd<sub>y'</sub>Mg<sub>1−x'−y'</sub>Se
multi-quantum-well structures grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Based on these
measurements, the authors predict and then verify the anticipated intersubband
transition energies. They investigate a representative
Zn<sub>0.5</sub>Cd<sub>0.5</sub>Se/Zn<sub>0.20</sub>Cd<sub>0.19</sub>Mg<sub>0.61</sub>Se
structure, for which the _E1_-_E2_ transition energy is predicted to be 178 meV
(6.97 µm). Intersubband absorption using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
exhibits a peak at 180 meV (6.89 µm), in excellent agreement with the
contactless electroreflectance measurements.
