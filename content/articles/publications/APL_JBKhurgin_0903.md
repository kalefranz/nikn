A density-matrix based theory of transport and lasing in quantum-cascade lasers reveals that large disparity between luminescent linewidth and broadening of the tunneling transition changes the design guidelines to favor strong coupling between injector and upper laser level. This conclusion is supported by the experimental evidence.
