This letter reports on a quantum cascade laser that exhibits simultaneous
dual-wavelength emission from two consecutive optical transitions in each active
region. These "cascaded" transitions—a second-excited state to first-excited
state and a first-excited state to ground state—yield light at ~9.5 and ~8.2 µm,
respectively, in good agreement with simulations. The two lasing wavelengths
have similar thresholds at the leading edge of a current pulse.
