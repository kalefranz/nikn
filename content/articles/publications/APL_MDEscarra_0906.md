Efficient use of applied voltage in quantum cascade (QC) lasers is a critical
factor in achieving high wall-plug efficiency and low compliance voltage. We
demonstrate a QC laser emitting at 4.2 Âµm featuring a low voltage defect and
short injector with only four quantum wells. Devices with a voltage defect of
20 meV, well below the energy of the longitudinal optical phonons, and a voltage
efficiency of 91%, a record value for QC lasers, are reported for pulsed
operation at 180 K. Voltage efficiencies of greater than 80% are exhibited at
room temperature. Overall performance showed wall-plug efficiencies ranging
from 21% at cryogenic temperatures to 5.3% at room temperature.
