We experimentally study the optical transition width and current transport
properties of a set of λ~8.0 µm quantum cascade (QC) structures with varying
injector barrier thickness and doping level. For this high-performance QC laser
structure, a 50% reduction in doping level and a 33% reduction in injection
barrier thickness yield five times stronger luminescence, 20% smaller optical
transition linewidth, and improved current-voltage characteristics. These
results demonstrate how high-performance QC laser structures can be engineered
to produce narrow gain spectra at and above room temperature.
