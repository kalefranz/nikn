A novel quantum cascade laser design with "two-step" coupling between the
injector and the upper laser state is demonstrated to achieve a widely
voltage-tunable laser spectrum. Electroluminescence from this design can be
tuned over a range of more than 200 cm<sup>−1</sup> with a tuning coefficient of
~700 cm<sup>−1</sup>/V per stage. Lasers based on this design provide a tuning range of
~100 cm<sup>−1</sup> (8.3–9 µm) above threshold with a tuning coefficient of
~900 cm<sup>−1</sup>/V per stage at a constant temperature of 295 K.
