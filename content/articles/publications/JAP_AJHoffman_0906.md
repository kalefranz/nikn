We report on a novel class of semiconductor metamaterials that employ a strongly
anisotropic dielectric function to achieve negative refraction in the
midinfrared region of the spectrum, ~8.5–13 µm. We present two types of
metamaterials, layered highly doped/undoped heterostructures and quantum well
superlattices that are highly anisotropic. Contrary to other optical
metamaterials these heterostructure systems are optically thick (up to 20 µm
thick), planar, and require no additional fabrication steps beyond the initial
growth. Using transmission and reflection measurements and modeling of the
highly doped heterostructures, we demonstrate that these materials exhibit
negative refraction. For the highly doped quantum well superlattices, we
demonstrate anomalous reflection due to the strong anisotropy of the material
but a determination of the sign of refraction is still difficult. This new
class of semiconductor metamaterials has great potential for waveguiding and
imaging applications in the long-wave infrared.
