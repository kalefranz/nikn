In this paper, we present our recent progress towards the realization of short
wavelength intersubband devices with wide band gap II-VI selenide
semiconductors. Intersubband electroluminescence at 4.8 μm was observed in a
ZnCdSe/ZnCdMgSe quantum cascade structure at temperatures up to room
temperature. We also developed a new ZnCdSe/MgSe quantum structure with
metastable MgSe barriers. Intersubband absorption in the 3-5 μm range was
observed. Calculations suggest that with this structure intersubband transitions
as short as 1.55 μm may be achieved.
