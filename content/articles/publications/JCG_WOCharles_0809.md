We report growth by molecular beam epitaxy of a
Zn<sub>x</sub>Cd<sub>1-x</sub>Se/Zn<sub>x'</sub>Cd<sub>y'</sub>Mg<sub>1-x'-y'</sub>Se
quantum cascade (QC) structure that was
designed for electroluminescence (EL) at ~4.5 µm. The QC active region is
comprised of a two-well asymmetric coupled quantum well (ACQW) structure, which
was thoroughly investigated to establish the growth conditions for the QC
structure. After growth of several ACQW test samples, the conditions for growth
were optimized for the QC structure. In-situ RHEED, photoluminescence (PL),
high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopy results were used for characterization. The QC structure grown
under these conditions exhibited EL at 4.8 µm, in excellent agreement with the
design value.
