We report our study on the effects of shortened quantum cascade (QC) laser
injector regions. While conventional short-wavelength QC lasers typically have
around seven or more injector region quantum wells, we investigate QC structures
with three and two injector wells. Improvements in threshold currents, output
powers, and wall-plug efficiencies are expected for fundamental reasons. At heat
sink temperatures near 80 K, we observe threshold current densities less than
0.5 kA/cm<sup>2</sup>, nearly 4 W peak output power, and wall-plug efficiencies
in excess of 20%. At room temperature, we see threshold current densities around
2.3 kA/cm<sup>2</sup>, output powers in excess of 1 W, and wall-plug
efficiencies around 7.6%. We also observe new effects in midinfrared QC lasers,
such as a pronounced negative differential resistance, pulse instabilities, and
multiple and varied turn-off mechanisms. These effects result from the greatly
abbreviated injector regions with highly discrete states.
