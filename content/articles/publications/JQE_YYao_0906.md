The voltage tunability of three types of quantum cascade laser designs is
investigated. The tuning coefficients and tuning ranges of electroluminescence
and laser emission from all designs are measured and compared with the
calculated results. A reduced tunability was observed in all lasers above
threshold. This is attributed to the decrease of resistance across the laser
active region (AR) as the photon density increases. A resumed tunability high
above threshold occurs in all lasers with anticrossed injector ground and upper
laser states. Lasers based on the anticrossed diagonal transition are tunable
above threshold, with a tuning range of about 30 cm<sup>-1</sup> (~3% of the laser emission
wavenumber), i.e., a tuning rate of
750 cm<sup>-1</sup>V<sup>-1</sup>â€¢period<sup>-1</sup> of the AR and the injector.
