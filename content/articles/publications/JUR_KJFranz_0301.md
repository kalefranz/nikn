The lack of a solid set of criteria for determining patentability of subject
matter—particularly subject matter dealing with life—has recently been of
increasing public concern in the United States. Alarm for patent practices
related to life systems ranges from patents being granted on
biochemical processes and the knowledge of these processes to the patenting of
entire organisms. One of the most volatile concerns is the patenting of human
genes or parts of genes since this genetic material is the basic informational
molecule for all life. Current patent law, legislated in 1952, has been
interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court to allow broad patents of DNA, biochemical
processes, and what are generally considered "inventions" of life systems.
Several issues are addressed in this paper regarding the unsound reasoning
underlying both the interpretation and execution of patent law. Lapses in logic
provide a gateway for businesses and individuals to take patenting to an
illogical and unworkable extreme. Patent Office disorder of this magnitude is
unnecessary and has great potential for harming the mission that the patent
office was designed to serve. Recently disclosed patent-granting guidelines
suggest the United States Patent and Trademark Office is not upholding its
Constitutional responsibility of promoting the progress of science.
