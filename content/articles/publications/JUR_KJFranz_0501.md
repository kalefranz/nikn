Carbon nanotubes hold significant promise for a vast number of materials
applications due to their unique mechanical, electrical, and gas storage
properties. Although carbon single-wall nanotubes (SWNTs) have been synthesized
since 1993 by the arc discharge method, and numerous other synthesis methods
have since been developed, no method has yet produced 100% pure carbon
nanotubes. Instead, a significant amount of impurities—various carbon structures
and metal catalysts—are present in the raw soot. While arc discharge was the
first method for SWNT synthesis, it also produces more impure raw soot in
comparison to the more recently developed laser vaporization, which has produced
the purest raw soot to date but is much slower. Geometry and thermal gradient
are appreciably different between traditional arc discharge systems and laser
vaporization systems. We report that, by incorporating some characteristics
inherent to a laser vaporization system into an arc discharge system,
improvement in the yield of SWNT raw soot may be achieved. This is accomplished
by confining the arc within a 50 mm diameter quartz tube, similar to laser
vaporization. We find through transmission electron microscopy and Raman
spectroscopy that SWNTs are made in significant numbers in this confined arc
discharge system, comparable to laser vaporization synthesized material. Further
study is, however, required to prove reproducibility and attain an exact value
for the purity of the produced raw soot.
