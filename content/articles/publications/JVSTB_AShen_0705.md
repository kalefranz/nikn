The authors report the study of intersubband transitions in ZnCdMgSe-based wide
band gap II-VI semiconductors. The samples were prepared by molecular beam
epitaxy on InP substrates. Both ZnCdSe/ZnCdMgSe multiple quantum wells and
CdSe/ZnCdMgSe quantum dot multilayer stacks were grown. Strong intersubband
absorption was observed in the samples. The results show that these materials
are very promising for fabricating intersubband devices in the mid- and
near-infrared spectral ranges.
