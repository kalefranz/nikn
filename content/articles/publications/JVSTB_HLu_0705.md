Two Zn<sub>x</sub>Cd<sub>1−x</sub>Se/Zn<sub>x'</sub>Cd<sub>y'</sub>Mg<sub>1−x'−y'</sub>Se
multiple quantum well structures were grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The
quantum well layer thickness of the multiple quantum well region was varied in
order to tune the intersubband transition energy. The high crystalline quality
of the material was demonstrated by high resolution x-ray diffraction.
Contactless electroreflectance (CER) spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy were used to characterize the intersubband transitions.
Excellent agreement between the estimated value obtained by CER and the value
measured by FTIR was achieved. Intersubband absorption at 6.89 and 5.37 µm was
observed demonstrating the ability to tune the properties of these wide band
gap II-VI materials for mid-IR intersubband device applications.
