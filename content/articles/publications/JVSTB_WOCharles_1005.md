The molecular beam epitaxial growth and electroluminescence (EL) properties of
Zn<sub>0.48</sub>Cd<sub>0.52</sub>Se/Zn<sub>0.24</sub>Cd<sub>0.18</sub>Mg<sub>0.58</sub>Se
quantum cascade (QC) structures are reported. The samples were composed of 30
repeats of a three-well active region. Cladding layers were inserted to isolate
the core of the EL structure from the heavily doped contact region and to obtain
optical confinement. Electroluminescence was observed in the 4–5 μm range. The
observed narrowing of the electroluminescence linewidth was tentatively
attributed, in part, to the incorporation of the ZnCdMgSe waveguide layers. A
test sample consisting of multiple asymmetric coupled quantum well active
regions separated by quaternary barrier layers was also investigated. The
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) absorption spectroscopy measurements suggest
that QC structures with EL emission in the 3–4 μm range can be achieved with
these materials.
