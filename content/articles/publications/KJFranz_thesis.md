Quantum cascade (QC) lasers are today’s most capable mid-infrared light sources.
With up to watt-level room temperature emission over a broad swath of
mid-infrared wavelengths, these tiny semiconductor devices enable a variety of
applications and technologies such as ultra-sensitive systems for detecting
trace molecules in the vapor phase. The foundation of a QC structure lies in
alternating hundreds of wide- and narrow-bandgap semiconductor layers to form a
coupled quantum well system. In this way, the laws of quantum mechanics are used
to precisely engineer electron transport and create artificial optical
transitions. The result is a material with capabilities not found in nature,
a truly "designer" material.

As a central theme in this thesis, we stress the remarkable flexibility of the
quantum cascade—the ability to highly tailor device structure for creative
design concepts. The QC idea, in fact, relies on no particular material system
for its implementation. While all QC lasers to date have been fabricated from
III–V materials such as InGaAs/AlInAs, I detail our preliminary work on
ZnCdSe/ZnCdMgSe—a II–VI materials system—where we have demonstrated
electroluminescence.

We then further discuss how the inherent QC flexibility can be exploited for
new devices that extend QC performance and capabilities. In this regard, we
offer the examples of excited state transitions and short injectors. Excited
state transitions are an avenue to enhancing optical gain, which is especially
needed for longer-wavelength devices where optical losses hinder performance.
Likewise, shortening the QC injector length over a conventional QC structure has
powerful implications for threshold current, output power, and wall-plug
efficiency. In both cases, novel physical effects are discovered. Pumping
electrons into highly excited states led to the discovery of high k- space
lasing from highly non-equilibrium electron distributions. Shortening QC
injector regions allowed us to observe “classical” superlattice effects such as
negative differential resistance and pulse instabilities. While interesting from
a scientific perspective, these unique phenomena shed new insight on internal
QC laser processes and may them- selves lead to further improvements in device
performance.
