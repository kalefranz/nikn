In this research, interband and intersubband optical properties of heavily doped
n-type CdSe quantum dots were investigated by temperature dependent
photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, picosecond time-resolved PL spectroscopy
and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Two doped and one undoped
CdSe quantum dot samples with multiple QD layers were grown over ZnCdMgSe
barrier layers on InP (001) substrate by molecular beam epitaxy. Heavy doping
leads to decreasing of activation energy of nonradiative recombination centers,
however, does not affect the luminescence efficiency of doped quantum dots. Time
resolved PL experiments show that the PL decay times of the doped samples have
weak dependence on dot size and are much longer than that of the undoped sample.
The two doped CdSe QD samples show strong intersubband IR absorption that peaked
at 2.54 μm, 2.69 μm and 3.51 μm.
