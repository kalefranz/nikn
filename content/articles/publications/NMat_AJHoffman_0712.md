An optical metamaterial is a composite in which subwavelength features, rather
than the constituent materials, control the macroscopic electromagnetic
properties of the material. Recently, properly designed metamaterials have
garnered much interest because of their unusual interaction with electromagnetic
waves. Whereas nature seems to have limits on the type of materials that exist,
newly invented metamaterials are not bound by such constraints. These newly
accessible electromagnetic properties make these materials an excellent platform
for demonstrating unusual optical phenomena and unique applications such as
subwavelength imaging and planar lens design. 'Negative-index materials', as
first proposed, required the permittivity and permeability to be simultaneously
less than zero, but such materials face limitations. Here, we demonstrate a
comparatively low-loss, three-dimensional, all-semiconductor metamaterial that
exhibits negative refraction for all incidence angles in the long-wave infrared
region and requires only an anisotropic dielectric function with a single
resonance. Using reflection and transmission measurements and a comprehensive
model of the material, we demonstrate that our material exhibits negative
refraction. This is furthermore confirmed through a straightforward beam optics
experiment.
