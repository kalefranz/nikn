We report on a quantum cascade (QC) laser structure with an energy configuration
able to establish local population inversion of electrons high in _k_-space
through intrinsic processes. We observe dual wavelength emission from two
discrete optical transitions lasing near _λ_ ≈ 9.5 and 8.2 µm.
Temperature-dependent performance attributes show that the two transitions are
highly coupled: competition for charge carriers is apparent from anti-correlated
behaviour in output power. The anti-correlated behaviour is further observed
through the temperature dependence of threshold currents, with the secondary
transition having a negative characteristic temperature T<sub>0</sub> before it sharply
becomes positive. The two optical transitions represent a conventional QC laser
transition at _k_ ≈ 0 and another laser transition from non-thermal electrons at
k ≈ 3.6×108 m<sup>-1</sup>.
