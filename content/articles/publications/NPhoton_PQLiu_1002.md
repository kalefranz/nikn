Quantum cascade lasers are promising mid-infrared semiconductor light sources
for molecular detection in applications such as environmental sensing or
medical diagnostics. For such applications, researchers have been striving to
improve device performance. Recently, improvements in wall plug efficiency have
been pursued with a view to realizing compact, portable, power-efficient and
high-power quantum cascade laser systems. However, advances have largely been
incremental, and the basic quantum design has remained unchanged for many years,
with the wall plug efficiency yet to reach above 35%. A crucial factor in
quantum cascade laser performance is the efficient transport of electrons into
the laser active regions. We recently theoretically described this transport
process as limited by the interface-roughness-induced detuning of resonant
tunnelling. Here, we report that an ‘ultrastrong coupling’ design strategy
overcomes this limiting factor and leads to the experimental realization of
quantum cascade lasers with 40–50% wall plug efficiency when operated in pulsed
mode at temperatures of 160 K or lower.
