We demonstrate an In<sub>0.635</sub>Al<sub>0.356</sub>As/In<sub>0.678</sub>Ga<sub>0.322</sub>As
strain compensated quantum cascade laser that employs heterogeneous injector
regions for low voltage defect operation. The active core consists of
interdigitated undoped and doped injectors followed by nominally identical
wavelength optical transitions. The undoped injector regions are designed with
reduced voltage defect while the doped injectors are of a more conventional
design. The measured average voltage defect is less than 79 meV. At 80 K, a
2.3 mm long, back facet high reflectance coated laser has an emission wavelength
of 4.7 Î¼m and outputs 2.3 W pulsed power with a peak wall-plug efficiency of
19%.
