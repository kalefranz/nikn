The voltage tuning of gain spectra in three types of Quantum Cascade laser
designs is investigated. The gain spectra of the luminescence device are tunable
over the whole voltage operation range for all designs. The lasers are as
tunable as the electroluminescence below threshold, while a reduced tunability
is observed in all lasers above threshold. This is attributed to the decrease of
resistance across the laser active region as the photon density increases. A
resumed tunability high above threshold occurs in all lasers based on the
anti-crossed designs. Lasers based on the anti-crossed diagonal transition are
tunable above threshold, with a tuning range of about 40 cm<sup>-1</sup> (~4% of the laser
emission wavenumber) at room temperature, i.e. a tuning rate of
800 cm<sup>-1</sup> per volt per period of active region and injector.
