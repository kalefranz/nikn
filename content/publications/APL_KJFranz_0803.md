This letter reports electroluminescence emission from a ZnCdSe/ZnCdMgSe quantum
cascade (QC) structure. With a two-well QC active region design, the II-VI
heterostructure was grown lattice matched on an InP substrate by molecular beam
epitaxy. Deep etched mesas were electrically pumped at current densities up to
10 kA/cm, producing optical emission centered near 4.8 Âµm, in good agreement
with the structure design. The light is predominantly TM polarized, confirming
its intersubband origin. Electroluminescence was observed from 78 to 300 K.
