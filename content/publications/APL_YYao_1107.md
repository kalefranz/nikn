We report ZnCdSe/ZnCdMgSe Quantum Cascade structures with “two-phonon” and
“bound-to-continuum” active region designs. The electroluminescence shows more
than 3 times higher luminescence efficiency and 40% narrower linewidth (<30 meV)
than previous reports. The measured turn-on voltage matches closely the
calculated value, indicating the improved electron transport characteristics in
these structures. A waveguide design suitable for mode confinement in this
material system is also presented, which resulted in a structure with a single
narrow electroluminescence peak for all temperatures from 80 to 300 K.
