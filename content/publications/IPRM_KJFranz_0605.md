We report on a novel quantum cascade laser design that utilizes wide active
region quantum wells to create a lasing transition between the second- and
first-excited states of the constituent wells. Electroluminescence and lasing
spectra confirm the presence of the optical transition at the expected energy,
but also show the conventional transition between energy levels resulting from
excited and ground states of the original quantum wells. As a result, the laser
produces simultaneous dual-wavelength emission at 8.2 μm and 9.3 μm.
