The authors report the growth of a II-VI
Zn<sub>x</sub>Cd<sub>1-x</sub>Se/Zn<sub>x’</sub>Cd<sub>y’</sub>Mg<sub>1-x’-y’</sub>Se
asymmetric coupled quantum well (asymmetric-CQW) structure that was used to
investigate the active region of an intersubband electroluminescence structure
designed for emission at λ=4.5 µm. Such a structure could comprise the active
region of a quantum cascade laser. The results of photoluminescence and Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy analysis show good agreement with the expected
transition energies predicted by simulation results for the asymmetric-CQW
structure. High resolution x-ray diffraction analysis indicates high structural
quality of the sample and good control of the growth.
