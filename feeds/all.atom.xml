Not only does it provide the RGB and Hex values for
the color on your screen directly below your mouse, it also tells you the name

just doesn't compete (or have the color name feature). &lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;...I made my

&lt;p&gt;If you're a contractor, why wouldn't you want to keep the actual source to
yourself?  You lock the company your contacting for into using your services in
perpetuity.  Good for the contractor; &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; bad for the procuring company.  My
guess is that less-than-competent and more "old school" contractors who aren't
able to keep up with technology's pace will push this tactic for their own job
security. But the contractor lock-in prevents the company from moving forward
with their product using another contractor if the relationship sours with the
current contractor.  It also prevents the company from transitioning away from
contract work to an in-house development team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of this document contains steps necessary to have the best chance for
getting quality code from a contractor.  I would consider each item mandatory.
There are also plenty of "nice to haves," but I want to keep this right now to
what I consider mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;You control the source control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your contractor will use the source control system that you provide.  It is your
company's own source control system, and you give and revoke permissions to your
own repositories.  Use Git.  Everybody uses Git today.  If your contractor
complains that Git is "too hard," run away as fast as you can.  Create an account
on either &lt;a href="http://www.github.com"&gt;github.com&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="http://www.bitbucket.com"&gt;bitbucket.com&lt;/a&gt;.  Both are widely used and great
products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Demand documentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documentation of the system that your contractor is designing should be part of
the deal.  Documented topics would include, for example,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thorough explanation of the system architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;thorough documentation of any API layers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;code deployment &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runbook"&gt;run book&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like source code revision control, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; should own the documentation and it
should be kept in a location that &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; control.  My recommendation is
Atlassian's &lt;a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/overview/team-collaboration-software"&gt;Confluence&lt;/a&gt;
product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One critical part of quality software is readable and comprehensible source code.
Professional programmers in a team environment should be adept at writing in-code
comments where necessary and in general write code that is overall
self-documenting.  &lt;em&gt;Not all code is self documenting!  Writing self-documenting
code takes deliberate effort.  Just because code compiles, it is not therefore
"self-documenting"!!&lt;/em&gt;  Advice here would be to  require that every public
function (within reason, so exclude getters, setters, etc.) have a
language-relevant documentation block (docstring, javadoc, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Source code tests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professional programmers write unit tests.  To be sure that the code being
developed runs as it should, demand unit tests be written by the programmers as
part of the project.  &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage"&gt;Code coverage&lt;/a&gt;
is a metric that describes what percent of your source code is "touched" or
covered by unit tests.  Include a code coverage stipulation as part of your
contract; a reasonable number is somewhere in the neighborhood of 80%.  Note
that there is a danger with using code coverage as a sole metric for test
quality.  From &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/695888/2127762"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; StackOverflow post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code coverage tells you what you definitely &lt;strong&gt;haven't&lt;/strong&gt; tested, not what you &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just realize that there are pitfalls to the code coverage metric and be aware of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Continuous Integration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There should be a
&lt;a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html"&gt;continuous integration&lt;/a&gt;
environment set up for the code base.  Whether you set this up or the contractor
really doesn't matter, as long as you definitely have access to monitor it.  The
value to you as the company will be in the ability to monitor project progress,
monitor code coverage and other code quality metrics, and monitor the status of
the current build (code compiling and all tests passing).
&lt;a href="http://jenkins-ci.org"&gt;Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; is certainly the most main-stream CI
technology, and you can apparently get a hosted version
&lt;a href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-overview.cb"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
Jenkins itself is free and open source, so you can deploy it to your own local
or cloud servers too.  Another interesting option might be
&lt;a href="http://travis-ci.com"&gt;Travis CI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;DevOps considerations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DevOps tasks are all those that deal with keeping your software running
&lt;em&gt;in production&lt;/em&gt;. Are your servers healthy, or are they becoming overburdened?
Is your application even running, or has something crashed?  Your architecture
might be one that has several interdependent components, and that the front door
is working properly doesn't necessarily mean a portion of the system hasn't
crashed elsewhere.  Server and application health requires constant, automated
monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area of DevOps is often separate from the software development itself.  Make
sure you have a DevOps strategy for system monitoring, and have the appropriate
knowledge or resources to take action when something fails.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="code"></category><category term="software development"></category><category term="contracting"></category></entry><entry><title>Room temperature and narrow intersubband electroluminescence from ZnCdSe/ZnCdMgSe quantum cascade laser structures</title><link href="http://notinkansasnow.com/publication/2011/07/room-temperature-and-narrow-intersubband-electroluminescence-from-zncdsezncdmgse-quantum-cascade-laser-structures/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-07-29T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Kale Franz</name></author><id>tag:notinkansasnow.com,2011-07-29:publication/2011/07/room-temperature-and-narrow-intersubband-electroluminescence-from-zncdsezncdmgse-quantum-cascade-laser-structures/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We report ZnCdSe/ZnCdMgSe Quantum Cascade structures with “two-phonon” and

than the constituent materials, control the macroscopic electromagnetic
properties of the material. Recently, properly designed metamaterials have
garnered much interest because of their unusual interaction with electromagnetic
waves. Whereas nature seems to have limits on the type of materials that exist,
newly invented metamaterials are not bound by such constraints. These newly
accessible electromagnetic properties make these materials an excellent platform
for demonstrating unusual optical phenomena and unique applications such as
subwavelength imaging and planar lens design. 'Negative-index materials', as
first proposed, required the permittivity and permeability to be simultaneously
less than zero, but such materials face limitations. Here, we demonstrate a
comparatively low-loss, three-dimensional, all-semiconductor metamaterial that
exhibits negative refraction for all incidence angles in the long-wave infrared
region and requires only an anisotropic dielectric function with a single
resonance. Using reflection and transmission measurements and a comprehensive
model of the material, we demonstrate that our material exhibits negative
refraction. This is furthermore confirmed through a straightforward beam optics
experiment.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="metamaterials"></category><category term="negative refractive index"></category></entry><entry><title>Optical Properties of Heavily Doped n-type CdSe Quantum Dots for Intersubband Device Applications</title><link href="http://notinkansasnow.com/publication/2007/09/optical-properties-of-heavily-doped-n-type-cdse-quantum-dots-for-intersubband-device-applications/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-09-06T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Kale Franz</name></author><id>tag:notinkansasnow.com,2007-09-06:publication/2007/09/optical-properties-of-heavily-doped-n-type-cdse-quantum-dots-for-intersubband-device-applications/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this research, interband and intersubband optical properties of heavily doped

region quantum wells to create a lasing transition between the second- and
first-excited states of the constituent wells. Electroluminescence and lasing
spectra confirm the presence of the optical transition at the expected energy,
but also show the conventional transition between energy levels resulting from
excited and ground states of the original quantum wells. As a result, the laser
produces simultaneous dual-wavelength emission at 8.2 μm and 9.3 μm.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="QCLs"></category><category term="lasers"></category></entry><entry><title>Carbon single-wall nanotube growth in a volumetrically confined arc discharge system</title><link href="http://notinkansasnow.com/publication/2004/08/carbon-single-wall-nanotube-growth-in-a-volumetrically-confined-arc-discharge-system/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2004-08-01T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Kale Franz</name></author><id>tag:notinkansasnow.com,2004-08-01:publication/2004/08/carbon-single-wall-nanotube-growth-in-a-volumetrically-confined-arc-discharge-system/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Carbon nanotubes hold significant promise for a vast number of materials
applications due to their unique mechanical, electrical, and gas storage
properties. Although carbon single-wall nanotubes (SWNTs) have been synthesized
since 1993 by the arc discharge method, and numerous other synthesis methods
have since been developed, no method has yet produced 100% pure carbon
nanotubes. Instead, a significant amount of impurities—various carbon structures
and metal catalysts—are present in the raw soot. While arc discharge was the
first method for SWNT synthesis, it also produces more impure raw soot in
comparison to the more recently developed laser vaporization, which has produced
the purest raw soot to date but is much slower. Geometry and thermal gradient
are appreciably different between traditional arc discharge systems and laser
vaporization systems. We report that, by incorporating some characteristics
inherent to a laser vaporization system into an arc discharge system,
improvement in the yield of SWNT raw soot may be achieved. This is accomplished
by confining the arc within a 50 mm diameter quartz tube, similar to laser
vaporization. We find through transmission electron microscopy and Raman
spectroscopy that SWNTs are made in significant numbers in this confined arc
discharge system, comparable to laser vaporization synthesized material. Further
study is, however, required to prove reproducibility and attain an exact value
for the purity of the produced raw soot.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="carbon nanotubes"></category></entry><entry><title>DNA Dilemma: A perspective on U.S. Patent and Trademark Office philosophy concerning life patents</title><link href="http://notinkansasnow.com/publication/2002/08/dna-dilemma-a-perspective-on-us-patent-and-trademark-office-philosophy-concerning-life-patents/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2002-08-01T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Kale Franz</name></author><id>tag:notinkansasnow.com,2002-08-01:publication/2002/08/dna-dilemma-a-perspective-on-us-patent-and-trademark-office-philosophy-concerning-life-patents/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The lack of a solid set of criteria for determining patentability of subject
matter—particularly subject matter dealing with life—has recently been of
increasing public concern in the United States. Alarm for patent practices
related to life systems ranges from patents being granted on
biochemical processes and the knowledge of these processes to the patenting of
entire organisms. One of the most volatile concerns is the patenting of human
genes or parts of genes since this genetic material is the basic informational
molecule for all life. Current patent law, legislated in 1952, has been
interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court to allow broad patents of DNA, biochemical
processes, and what are generally considered "inventions" of life systems.
Several issues are addressed in this paper regarding the unsound reasoning
underlying both the interpretation and execution of patent law. Lapses in logic
provide a gateway for businesses and individuals to take patenting to an
illogical and unworkable extreme. Patent Office disorder of this magnitude is
unnecessary and has great potential for harming the mission that the patent
office was designed to serve. Recently disclosed patent-granting guidelines
suggest the United States Patent and Trademark Office is not upholding its
Constitutional responsibility of promoting the progress of science.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="patents"></category><category term="dna"></category></entry></feed>
