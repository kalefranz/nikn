quantum cascade laser performance is the efficient transport of electrons into

With up to watt-level room temperature emission over a broad swath of
mid-infrared wavelengths, these tiny semiconductor devices enable a variety of
applications and technologies such as ultra-sensitive systems for detecting
trace molecules in the vapor phase. The foundation of a QC structure lies in
alternating hundreds of wide- and narrow-bandgap semiconductor layers to form a
coupled quantum well system. In this way, the laws of quantum mechanics are used
to precisely engineer electron transport and create artificial optical
transitions. The result is a material with capabilities not found in nature,
a truly "designer" material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a central theme in this thesis, we stress the remarkable flexibility of the
quantum cascade—the ability to highly tailor device structure for creative
design concepts. The QC idea, in fact, relies on no particular material system
for its implementation. While all QC lasers to date have been fabricated from
III–V materials such as InGaAs/AlInAs, I detail our preliminary work on
ZnCdSe/ZnCdMgSe—a II–VI materials system—where we have demonstrated
electroluminescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then further discuss how the inherent QC flexibility can be exploited for
new devices that extend QC performance and capabilities. In this regard, we
offer the examples of excited state transitions and short injectors. Excited
state transitions are an avenue to enhancing optical gain, which is especially
needed for longer-wavelength devices where optical losses hinder performance.
Likewise, shortening the QC injector length over a conventional QC structure has
powerful implications for threshold current, output power, and wall-plug
efficiency. In both cases, novel physical effects are discovered. Pumping
electrons into highly excited states led to the discovery of high k- space
lasing from highly non-equilibrium electron distributions. Shortening QC
injector regions allowed us to observe “classical” superlattice effects such as
negative differential resistance and pulse instabilities. While interesting from
a scientific perspective, these unique phenomena shed new insight on internal
QC laser processes and may them- selves lead to further improvements in device
performance.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="lasers"></category><category term="QCLs"></category><category term="thesis"></category></entry><entry><title>Wide Band Gap II-VI Selenides for Short Wavelength Intersubband Devices</title><link href="http://notinkansasnow.com/publication/2009/03/wide-band-gap-ii-vi-selenides-for-short-wavelength-intersubband-devices/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2009-03-15T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Kale J.

than the constituent materials, control the macroscopic electromagnetic
properties of the material. Recently, properly designed metamaterials have
garnered much interest because of their unusual interaction with electromagnetic
waves. Whereas nature seems to have limits on the type of materials that exist,
newly invented metamaterials are not bound by such constraints. These newly
accessible electromagnetic properties make these materials an excellent platform
for demonstrating unusual optical phenomena and unique applications such as
subwavelength imaging and planar lens design. 'Negative-index materials', as
first proposed, required the permittivity and permeability to be simultaneously
less than zero, but such materials face limitations. Here, we demonstrate a
comparatively low-loss, three-dimensional, all-semiconductor metamaterial that
exhibits negative refraction for all incidence angles in the long-wave infrared
region and requires only an anisotropic dielectric function with a single
resonance. Using reflection and transmission measurements and a comprehensive
model of the material, we demonstrate that our material exhibits negative
refraction. This is furthermore confirmed through a straightforward beam optics
experiment.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="metamaterials"></category><category term="negative refractive index"></category><category term="semiconductors"></category></entry><entry><title>Optical Properties of Heavily Doped n-type CdSe Quantum Dots for Intersubband Device Applications</title><link href="http://notinkansasnow.com/publication/2007/09/optical-properties-of-heavily-doped-n-type-cdse-quantum-dots-for-intersubband-device-applications/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2007-09-06T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Kale J.

applications due to their unique mechanical, electrical, and gas storage
properties. Although carbon single-wall nanotubes (SWNTs) have been synthesized
since 1993 by the arc discharge method, and numerous other synthesis methods
have since been developed, no method has yet produced 100% pure carbon
nanotubes. Instead, a significant amount of impurities—various carbon structures
and metal catalysts—are present in the raw soot. While arc discharge was the
first method for SWNT synthesis, it also produces more impure raw soot in
comparison to the more recently developed laser vaporization, which has produced
the purest raw soot to date but is much slower. Geometry and thermal gradient
are appreciably different between traditional arc discharge systems and laser
vaporization systems. We report that, by incorporating some characteristics
inherent to a laser vaporization system into an arc discharge system,
improvement in the yield of SWNT raw soot may be achieved. This is accomplished
by confining the arc within a 50 mm diameter quartz tube, similar to laser
vaporization. We find through transmission electron microscopy and Raman
spectroscopy that SWNTs are made in significant numbers in this confined arc
discharge system, comparable to laser vaporization synthesized material. Further
study is, however, required to prove reproducibility and attain an exact value
for the purity of the produced raw soot.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="carbon nanotubes"></category></entry><entry><title>DNA Dilemma: A perspective on U.S. Patent and Trademark Office philosophy concerning life patents</title><link href="http://notinkansasnow.com/publication/2002/08/dna-dilemma-a-perspective-on-us-patent-and-trademark-office-philosophy-concerning-life-patents/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2002-08-01T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Kale J.

matter—particularly subject matter dealing with life—has recently been of
increasing public concern in the United States. Alarm for patent practices
related to life systems ranges from patents being granted on
biochemical processes and the knowledge of these processes to the patenting of
entire organisms. One of the most volatile concerns is the patenting of human
genes or parts of genes since this genetic material is the basic informational
molecule for all life. Current patent law, legislated in 1952, has been
interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court to allow broad patents of DNA, biochemical
processes, and what are generally considered "inventions" of life systems.
Several issues are addressed in this paper regarding the unsound reasoning
underlying both the interpretation and execution of patent law. Lapses in logic
provide a gateway for businesses and individuals to take patenting to an
illogical and unworkable extreme. Patent Office disorder of this magnitude is
unnecessary and has great potential for harming the mission that the patent
office was designed to serve. Recently disclosed patent-granting guidelines
suggest the United States Patent and Trademark Office is not upholding its
Constitutional responsibility of promoting the progress of science.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="patents"></category><category term="dna"></category></entry></feed>
